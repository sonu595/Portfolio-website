        I’m a Full Stack Developer currently pursuing my college degree and building projects to improve my practical skills. I mainly work with Java for backend development and React for frontend. I have experience working on freelance projects where I learned how to structure applications, manage APIs, and write clean and understandable code. I focus on building things that work well and are easy to maintain rather than overcomplicating solutions.

        Right now, I’m working on a chat application where I am practicing API development, authentication, validation, and handling data properly. I’m also learning how to manage API responses on the frontend to create smooth user experiences. Along with this, I regularly practice Data Structures and Algorithms to improve my logic and problem-solving skills. I’m continuously learning and trying to become better with each project I build.
